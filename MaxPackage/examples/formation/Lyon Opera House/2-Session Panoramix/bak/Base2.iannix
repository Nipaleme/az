/*
 *	This method stores all the operations made through IanniX scripts.
 *	You can add some commands here to make your own scripts!
 *	Scripts are written in Javascript but even with a limited knowledge of Javascript, many types of useful scripts can be created.
 *	
 *	Beyond the standard javascript commands, the run() function is used to send commands to IanniX.
 *	Commands must be provided to run() as a single string.
 *	For example, run("zoom 100"); sets the display zoom to 100%.
 *	
 *	To combine numeric parameters with text commands to produce a string, use the concatenation operator.
 *	In the following example center_x and center_y are in numeric variables and must be concatenated to the command string.
 *	Example: run("setPos current " + center_x + " " + center_y + " 0");
 *	
 *	To learn IanniX commands, perform an manipulation in IanniX graphical user interface, and see the Helper window.
 *	You'll see the syntax of the command-equivalent action.
 *	
 *	And finally, remember that most of commands must target an object.
 *	Global syntax is always run("<command name> <target> <arguments>");
 *	Targets can be an ID (number) or a Group ID (string name of group) (please see "Info" tab in Inspector panel).
 *	Special targets are "current" (last used ID), "all" (all the objects) and "lastCurve" (last used curve).
 *
